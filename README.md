# Autonomous-Warehouse-Robot-using-Computer-Vision
This project describes the techniques for analyzing, designing, controlling and improving the packaging section in warehouse areas. Due to the increased demand in manpower and to avoid flaws and delays in delivery this prototype can be implemented. So a microcontroller based ball following robot carrying the products can be designed to follow a certain path. A Ball follower robot is a electronic system that can detect and follow a ball or a certain path of the ball.
The robot uses ultrasonic sensor to sense the nearby obstacles and uses camera module to do computer vision. Using computer vision, a refined blob detection is done using dilation and erosion i.e., filters of image processing. The microprocessor used here is raspberry pi which is kind of a mini computer with greater advantages. The ability to do the work around the clock without any errors is the best thing a system can do. This helps and simplifies the jobs in warehouses and reduce the manpower and increase the productivity. This technology focuses on the flawless delivery, and to increase efficiency.
